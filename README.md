# The <i>Rudimentum Novitiorum</i> Map 

Immersive environment based on the world map printed in the "Rudimentum Novitiorum" (1475). Project of developed as Visiting student at EPFL - eM+. Used software: Unreal Engine 5.1

## The project

The project is a prototype of a design proposal elaborated by Khajehnouri Shayan, Daghfal Mariella and Tang Cindy in the framework of the course [Cultural Data Sculpting](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/cultural-data-sculpting-DH-404), held by Prof Kenderdine for the MSc in "Digital Humanities" at EPFL.

It consists of an immersive and interactive environment for Panorama+ Visualization System based on the map contained in the "Rudimentum Novitiorum" (1475):

Developed in Unreal Engine 5.1, it reproduces a part of the world (the landscape now corresponds to Asia, but only the upper right quarter is refined and populated) and provides a sample of animation (sample scenario: Ophir).

Besides the actual development of the environment and of its actorsÂ´ behaviors, the project also required an analysis and translation of the original Latin manuscript. Indeed, every event happening in the digital map is a reconstruction of the stories described in the _Rudimentum_.
